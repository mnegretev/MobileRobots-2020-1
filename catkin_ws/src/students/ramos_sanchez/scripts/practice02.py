# AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOTS - UNAM, FI, 2020-1
# PRACTICE 2 - PATH PLANNING BY DIJKSTRA AND A-STAR WITH MAP INFLATION AND NEARNESS
#
# Instructions:
# Write the code necessary to plan a path using 
# Dijkstra and A star.
# Before planning, map obstacles must be inflated and nearness should be taken into account
# as part of the cost function.
